# E-commerce_house_appliances_exploratory
Exploratory testing on an E-commerce house appliances website
#Task
There was a site that had few weeks of development and, while from far looks like it is working, it has dozens of issues.

Here is this site - https://qatest-dev.indvp.com/

My task task was to:
- Find 10 functional bugs and 2 bugs from each of the following bug types - content, visual, performance, cross-browser and cross-device on this site
- Register them in a google sheet
- Describe bugs to enable developers to understand what is wrong and what is expected result
- Order bugs in the order of priority - from most critical ones on top to less critical ones under
