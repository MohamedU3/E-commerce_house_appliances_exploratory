# Purpose
Exploratory testing on an E-commerce house appliances website
# What I was assigned to do
There was a site that had few weeks of development and, while from far looks like it is working, it has dozens of issues.

Here is this site - https://qatest-dev.indvp.com/

My task task was to:
- Find 10 functional bugs and 2 bugs from each of the following bug types - content, visual, performance, cross-browser and cross-device on this site
- Register them in a google sheet
- Describe bugs to enable developers to understand what is wrong and what is expected result
- Order bugs in the order of priority - from most critical ones on top to less critical ones under
  
# Challenge
This task was relatively easy since the website was full of bugs however, since I was asked to prioritize the bugs from minor to major, the challenge was to find the "major" bugs which would really affect the website and the companies reputition. The website was full of minor bugs and it was a little tricky to find the major ones.
